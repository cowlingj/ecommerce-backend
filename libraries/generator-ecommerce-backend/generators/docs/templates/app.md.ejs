## Running the App

The scripts available to run the application (using `npm run-script`),
including [lifecycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) are:

<%_ Object.entries(scripts || {}).forEach((script) => { _%>
  - <%= script[0] %>: `<%- script[1] %>`
<%_ }); _%>
<%_ if (Object.keys(scripts).length === 0) { _%>
  > There are no scripts for this app
<%_ }; _%>

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set with the use of the `dotenv` package for development only.
Copy the included `.env.sample` to `.env` to configure the application using those environment variables.
